          "question": "What considerations should an Agentforce Specialist be aware of when using Record Snapshots grounding in a prompt template?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Activities such as tasks and events are excluded.",
            "B": "Empty data, such as fields without values or sections without limits, is filtered out.",
            "C": "Email addresses associated with the object are excluded."
          },
          "correctAnswer": "A",
          "explanation": "When using Record Snapshots to ground a prompt, Salesforce includes fields on the page layout but specifically excludes Activity data (Tasks and Events). If this data is needed, it must be retrieved via a Flow or related list grounding."
        },
        {
          "id": 2,
          "question": "Universal Containers is rolling out a new generative AI initiative. Which Prompt Builder limitation should the Agentforce Specialist be aware of?",

            "C": "Sales Email prompt templates only support Lead and Contact objects."
          },
          "correctAnswer": "C",
          "explanation": "Sales Email prompt templates are currently restricted to the Lead and Contact objects. Other template types, like Flex or Field Generation, have broader object support, including custom objects."

        {
          "id": 3,
          "question": "Universal Containers wants to detect toxic language in LLM-generated content. Which Trust Layer action confirms toxicity is managed correctly?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Export toxicity detection logs from Setup.",
            "B": "Create a flow that emails when toxicity exceeds a threshold.",

            "B": "Performs an HTTP callout to an LLM provider.",
            "C": "Uses LLM technology to interpret and generate responses."
          },
          "correctAnswer": "C",
          "explanation": "The Agentforce engine uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to semantically understand the user's intent (the request) and then generates a conversational response or plan of action."

          },
          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "Agents operate under a specific user context (often the 'Agentforce Service Agent' user). Like any Salesforce user, if they need to query or interact with a specific object, they must have at least 'Read' access to that object in their permission set."

          },
          "correctAnswer": "C",
          "explanation": "Temperature is the standard LLM hyperparameter for controlling randomness. A low temperature (near 0) produces deterministic/consistent responses, while a high temperature (near 1) produces more creative/random responses."
        },
        {
          "id": 11,
          "question": "How should Agentforce integrate conversational AI with an existing auto-launched flow?",

          },
          "correctAnswer": "B",
