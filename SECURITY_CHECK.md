# 🔒 Mockmate Security Audit

## ✅ Safe status: SECURE

Your project is currently configured to prevent accidental leakage of API keys.

### 1. Git Protection (.gitignore)

The following files are **ignored** by Git. Even if you run `git add .`, these files will NOT be uploaded to GitHub:

- `.env` (Contains your Groq Key `gsk_...`)
- `.env.local` (Contains Gemini & Groq keys)
- `.env.development.local`
- `.env.test.local`
- `.env.production.local`

### 2. Codebase Check

- **No hardcoded keys found** in TypeScript/JavaScript files.
- Keys are accessed via `process.env.GOOGLE_API_KEY` meant for server-side use only.
- Keys are **NOT** prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`, meaning they are not exposed to the browser/client-side code automatically.

### 3. Deployment Safety

- `next.config.js` does NOT expose sensitive keys (only the public Azure URL).
- `package.json` does not contain secrets in scripts.

## ⚠️ Important Rules for You

1. **Never copy-paste** your keys directly into `page.tsx` or `route.ts`. Always use `process.env`.
2. **Never upload** `.env` files manually.
3. If you deploy to Vercel/Netlify, add the keys in their **Project Settings > Environment Variables** dashboard.
